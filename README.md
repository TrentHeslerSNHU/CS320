## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure that your code, program, or software is secure is to perform extensive testing. Personally, I believe one should perform multiple different forms of testing, including static, dynamic, and vulnerability testing. Ideally, the code would be developed iteratively and many of these tests would be performed on each iteration.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I feel that the best way to get user requirements is to have meetings with the clients and stakeholders. This allows them to describe to you, in their own words, how they would like the system to perform and what functions it should include. From there, I would review transcripts of these meetings and any available requirement documents in order to create a bulleted checklist of system requirements.

## How do I approach designing software?
Once I had a sufficiently thorough checklist, as described above, I would look through it and determine which list items were dependent on others. I would then rank the requirements based on importance and begin creating code, starting with the highest priority items. Ideally, I would also have regular meetings with the clients and stakeholders to get feedback on the current iteration, to better direct and refine my development efforts. Once the software was ostensibly complete, I would ideally like to consult a penetration tester, if appropriate for the client's threat model, to review and test the finished product for vulnerabilities.
